<P>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which
a technical committee has been established has the right to be
represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.</P>

<P>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules
given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.</P>

<P>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International
Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical
committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication
as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the
member bodies casting a vote. </P>

<P>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this
document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.</P>

<P>ISO 10303-21 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, <I>Automation
systems and integration</I>, Subcommittee SC 4, <I>Industrial data</I>.</P>

<P>This third edition of ISO 10303-21 cancels and replaces the second
edition (ISO 10303-21:2002), of which it constitutes a technical revision. </P>

<P>ISO 10303 is organized as a series of parts, each published separately.
The structure of ISO 10303 is described in ISO 10303-1.</P>

<P>Each part of ISO 10303 is a member of one of the following series:
description methods, implementation methods, conformance testing
methodology and framework, integrated generic resources, integrated
application resources, application protocols, abstract test suites,
application interpreted constructs and application modules. This part
is a member of the implementation methods series.
